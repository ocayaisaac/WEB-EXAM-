        <p>Tourism is a complex sector and is strongly linked to supply chains from other market<br>

          influenced by foreign affairs laws and labour and environmental policies. Building a strong and <br>
          resilient tourism company is crucial in a world experiencing an economic crisis, pandemics, and <br>

      </div>

<p>Safari tours is a great way to inspire and motivate students.
The benefits of going on tour extend from technical development to personal development: it is a way for
 young people to build in confidence and develop as an ensemble, with the opportunity to perform in iconic 
 venues around the world and bond as a group.

<p style="border: dotted;"> <h3>The Benefits of Touring</h3>
<h5>Safari tours will show you you need touring</h5>  
Networking while Touring
When on tour, you can find plenty of people to work with who will help you out. You’ve just 
got to be nice to them and treat them with respect. Even if they aren’t the greatest to you,
still try to be kind and respectful and it might turn them around. They will definitely remember 
that when they have to work with you again and will help your shows be better. Becoming friends with 
bands on tour will help out a lot. They can help you get shows in their towns and in return, you can
 help them get shows. Trade offs are always great to do. Local bands already have fans going to their
  shows and becoming friends with the ones you’ll be playing with will help you have people willing to 
  see you when in town. Become friends with them before asking for favors, though. You actually want to
   have a friendship and bond with these people. Talk to them on FaceBook or Twitter before going on tour to
    get to know them. Everyone you work with on tour is important for how it will go.
     Get to know the promoters, sound guys, and anyone working the venues. Learn their
      names and remember for the next time you play there. They will be impressed and more
       willing to help you for future events. They will also talk you up to other venues and 
       promoters and help you get more shows in the area, and possibly in other cities as well</p>
